# Project 2 Instructions

This node application uses various plugins (located in the (package.json)[https://github.com/marti5a6/it3038c-scripts/blob/main/project2/package.json]) to host a local server, allowing the machine (or devices on the same network) to connect to the system administration panel (at localhost:3000), where you can see information about the system and network. The node server is built from express, and uses the pug templating system to append javascript outputs to the webpage. Additionally, the webpage is responsively designed using BootStrap 5. 


## Instructions

To use this application, node needs to be present (and possibly up to date):

If the required packages are not present, install them:

* In your terminal, change directory (cd) to the project directory (project2), and run "npm install".

Then, run the application as normal:

* Using the tool of your choice, run the server.js file.

Enjoy!
