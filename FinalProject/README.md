# Final Project Overview

This project consists of a JavaScript server built in node.js, and a python script.

The server uses express, and the script uses Requests to scrape the server's api, printing a movie and its details at random.


## Instructions

**[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) are required.**

If the Express package is not present, install it:
> Enter "npm install express" in your preferred CLI.

To use this script, the python package installer (PIP) needs to be up to date:

> In PowerShell, enter "py -m pip install --upgrade pip"

> In Linux Terminal, enter "python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip"

If the Requests package is not present, install it:

> In PowerShell, enter "py -m pip install requests"

> In Linux Terminal, enter "python3 -m pip install requests"

Run the server as normal:

> Enter "node api.js" in your preferred CLI while in the directory.

Then, run the script as normal:

> In PowerShell, enter "py MovieRandomizer.py" while in the directory.

> In Linux Terminal, enter "python3 MovieRandomizer.py" while in the directory.

## Enjoy!
