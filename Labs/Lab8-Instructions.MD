# Lab 8 Instructions

This python script uses BeautifulSoup and Requests to scrape the web, printing a list of Ohio senators from [ohio.gov](https://legislature.ohio.gov/legislators/senate-directory).


## Instructions

To use this script, the python package installer (PIP) needs to be up to date:

* In PowerShell, enter "py -m pip install --upgrade pip"
* In Linux Terminal, enter "python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip"

If the BeautifulSoup package is not present, install it:

* In PowerShell, enter "py -m pip install bs4"
* In Linux Terminal, enter "python3 -m pip install bs4"

If the Requests package is not present, install it:

* In PowerShell, enter "py -m pip install requests"
* In Linux Terminal, enter "python3 -m pip install requests"

Then, run the script as normal:

* In PowerShell, enter "py Lab8.py" while in the directory.
* In Linux Terminal, enter "python3 Lab8.py" while in the directory.

Enjoy!
