# Lab 7 Instructions

This python script uses BeautifulSoup and Requests to scrape the web, based on the user input. There are 3 outputs possible including full scrape, tag select, and id select. 


## Instructions

To use this script, the python package installer (PIP) needs to be up to date:

* In PowerShell, enter "py -m pip install --upgrade pip"

If the BeautifulSoup package is not present, install it:

* In PowerShell, enter "py -m pip install beautifulsoup4"
* In Linux Terminal, enter "python3 -m pip install beautifulsoup4"

If the Requests package is not present, install it:

* In PowerShell, enter "py -m pip install requests"

Then, run the script as normal:
